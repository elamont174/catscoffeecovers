### Deployment

Site is deployed with Heroku which is a cloud platform that lets developers create, deploy, monitor and manage apps.
The deployed site can be found [here](https://catscoffeecovers-448595c73efd.herokuapp.com/).
These steps assume that you have a Heroku account and are logged in.

6. The app has been created

**Deploying**
1. Go to the app Dashboard
2. Click the 'Settings' tab

- (KEY)CLOUDINARY_URL: (VALUE) Copy the Cloudinary URL from your env.py file without quotation marks

4. Click the "Fork" button (found above the Settings button).

- Run the server: python3 manage.py runserver
- Stop the app once it's loaded: CTRL+C or âŒ˜+C
- Make any necessary migrations: python3 manage.py makemigrations
